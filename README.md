# Particular
Particular is a 3D particle simulation tool optimized with Taichi, capable of handling hundreds of thousands of particles (or more) depending on your hardware. 


### Requirements
* Python 3.7 - 3.11 (3.12 isn't supported by Taichi)
* Libraries [Taichi]
### Usage

* Simulation settings, such as particle count and restitution value, are adjustable in [sim.py](/sim.py).
* After configuring the initial settings, run [sim.py](/sim.py). You will see on-screen simulation controls for gravity, container size, and more.
